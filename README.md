# Description
Designed and developed a Tenzies game application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. Tenzies is a dice game where players aim to roll the same number on all their dice as quickly as possible. The user interface is designed to provide a seamless gaming experience, with intuitive controls for rolling the dice and tracking the progress. Additionally, the application includes features such as score tracking, and interactive animations to enhance the overall gameplay. In this application, users can enjoy playing Tenzies directly in their web browser. The game logic was implemented using JavaScript to ensure smooth and interactive gameplay.

# Initialize a demo project locally

    1. Initialize a vite-pages project (with npm 7+):
        execute npm init vite-pages app-demo -- --template app to initialize an app project, or
        execute npm init vite-pages library-demo -- --template lib to initialize a library project, or
        execute npm init vite-pages library-monorepo-demo -- --template lib-monorepo to initialize a library project with monorepo setup.
        If you are using npm 6.x, the extra double-dash before --template should be deleted. For example, npm init vite-pages app-demo --template app.
    2. npm install
    3. npm run dev and play with the local dev environment.
    4. npm run build.
    5. npm run ssr. You can disable javascript in your browser,    to  verify if it can still render.
